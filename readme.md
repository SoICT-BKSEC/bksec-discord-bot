# Hweplir

Hweplir is a Discord bot for managing CTF participation in one server. It is written in TypeScript with discord.js v14 and stores registered CTF data in a local SQLite database (`ctf.db`).

## What the bot does

- Fetches CTF event data from CTFtime.
- Registers a CTF into the Discord server.
- Creates a Discord category, CTF role, info channel, and challenge channels.
- Stores CTF metadata, Discord IDs, archive time, and archive state in SQLite.
- Lists registered CTFs and lets users opt in or out of post-event access with a per-CTF role.
- Lets administrators update shared login information; passwords use Discord spoilers and are removed automatically when the competition ends.
- Opens archive-role access at competition end and archives CTFtime categories after a seven-day grace period.
- Supports manually-created CTF categories that are not on CTFtime.
- Provides admin utilities for deleting, importing, fixing, and permission-locking CTF categories.
- Can optionally provide a configurable server-role verification command.
- Handles pagination and confirmation buttons for interactive commands.
- Tracks challenge threads, claims, status, solves, points, writeups, and a pinned live dashboard.
- Sends persisted CTF reminders and refreshes countdowns every five minutes.
- Logs bot activity and errors with Winston.

## Commands

Slash commands are deployed to the guild configured by `SERVER_ID` whenever the bot starts.
In the tables below, `<value>` is required and `[value]` is optional. See
[`docs/commands.md`](docs/commands.md) for detailed behavior.

### CTFtime commands

| Command | Access | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/ct-info_find <search-key>` | Member | Search CTFtime by event ID or event name. |
| `/ct-info_ongo` | Member | Show currently ongoing CTFs. |
| `/ct-info_upco [page] [step]` | Member | Show upcoming CTFs with pagination. |
| `/ct-reg <ctftime-id>` | Admin | Register a CTF from CTFtime and create its Discord resources. |
| `/ct-regacc <username> <password> [cate_id]` | Admin | Update shared credentials in the private CTF information message. |

`/ct-reg` and `/ct-regacc` require `ADMIN_ROLE_ID` or Discord Administrator permission.

### General commands

| Command | Access | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/whoami` | Member | Show bot information, uptime, memory usage, and CTF counts. |
| `/c-list [order] [page] [step]` | Member | List registered CTFs from the local database. |
| `/c-view <ctf-name>` | Member | Add or remove the selected per-CTF role. This role grants post-event access; live access is controlled by `ACTIVE_CTF_ROLEID`. |

### Challenge commands

Challenge-management commands must be used in a registered CTF category. Except for writeup commands, they require `ACTIVE_CTF_ROLEID` or Discord Administrator permission.

| Command | Where | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/challenge create <name> <category> [points]` | Matching `web`, `crypto`, `pwn`, `rev`, `forensics`, or `misc` channel | Create a tracked challenge thread. |
| `/challenge claim` | Challenge thread | Add yourself to the claimant list. |
| `/challenge release` | Challenge thread | Remove yourself from the claimant list. |
| `/challenge status <value>` | Challenge thread | Set the state to `working`, `idea`, or `unclaimed`. |
| `/challenge dashboard` | Registered CTF channel or challenge thread | Create or refresh the pinned progress dashboard. |
| `/solve <members> [points]` | Challenge thread | Store the solver list, mark the challenge solved, rename the thread, refresh the dashboard, and announce the solve. |
| `/writeup claim` | Solved challenge thread | Claim responsibility for the challenge writeup. |
| `/writeup submit <url>` | Solved challenge thread | Submit an HTTP(S) writeup or pull-request URL; only the claimant can submit it. |

Sending the first member message in an unsolved challenge thread automatically adds that member to the claimant list. If the thread was created manually in a challenge channel, the bot registers it before adding the claimant. Multiple members may claim the same challenge.

### Admin commands

These commands require `ADMIN_ROLE_ID` or Discord Administrator permission unless noted otherwise.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/admin-hide` | Immediately process CTF categories that have passed their archive time. |
| `/admin-reg_special <name> <hide_after>` | Register a manual CTF that is not listed on CTFtime. |
| `/admin-delete <search_id>` | Find a CTF by CTFtime/category ID and choose whether to delete everything or keep its channels private. |
| `/admin-add [cate_id]` | Import an existing Discord category into the CTF database; the current category is used when omitted. |
| `/admin-deny-role` | Deny the configured deny role from viewing existing CTF categories. |
| `/admin-fix` | Rebuild lifecycle permissions for live, ended, and archived CTF categories. |
| `/admin-unsolve` | Undo an accidental challenge solve. |
| `/verifyg10 <user>` | Swap the configured guest/member roles; authorization uses `VERIFY_ALLOWED_ROLE_ID`. |

`/verifyg10` is registered only when `VERIFY_REMOVE_ROLE_ID`, `VERIFY_GRANT_ROLE_ID`, and `VERIFY_ALLOWED_ROLE_ID` are all configured.

### Disabled club-task commands

The older training-task workflow is implemented but not currently registered, so `/issue-task`, `/submit`, `/task-status`, and `/show-all` do not appear in Discord. Its `TASK_ADMIN_CHANNEL_ID` and `TASK_ROLE_*` variables are not required for the core CTF workflow.

## CTF lifecycle

1. **Live:** `@everyone` is denied and `ACTIVE_CTF_ROLEID` can view the category. The per-CTF role and `VIEW_ALL_CTF_ROLEID` do not grant live access.
2. **Competition ended:** the scheduler removes shared credentials, keeps `@everyone` denied, and grants the per-CTF role plus `VIEW_ALL_CTF_ROLEID`. It also posts the end reminder and refreshes the dashboard.
3. **Archive time reached:** CTFtime events are archived seven days after the competition ends. Manual events use the `hide_after` value supplied to `/admin-reg_special`.

The scheduler runs every five minutes. Reminder delivery is persisted in SQLite, so restarting the bot does not duplicate already-sent 24-hour, 1-hour, start, 3-hours-left, 1-hour-left, or end notifications. Notifications and completed writeups are sent to the read-only `announcements` channel.

## Runtime requirements

- Bun
- Dependencies from `package.json`
- A Discord bot token
- The **Message Content Intent** enabled in the Discord Developer Portal (used for automatic challenge claiming)
- A Discord server where the bot can manage roles, channels, messages, threads, and scheduled events

The bot role must be above every role it creates, grants, removes, or deletes. Its channel permissions should include View Channels, Manage Channels, Send Messages, Embed Links, Read Message History, Manage Messages, Create Public Threads, Send Messages in Threads, and Manage Threads.

Required environment variables:

```env
SERVER_ID=discord_guild_id
BOT_TOKEN=discord_bot_token
VIEW_ALL_CTF_ROLEID=role_that_can_view_all_ctfs
ACTIVE_CTF_ROLEID=role_for_current_ctf_players
ADMIN_ROLE_ID=role_allowed_to_manage_ctfs
```

Optional environment variables:

```env
DB_PATH=optional_sqlite_database_path
LOG_CHANNELID=channel_for_bot_logs
DENY_CTF_ROLEID=role_blocked_from_ctf_categories
VERIFY_REMOVE_ROLE_ID=optional_guest_role
VERIFY_GRANT_ROLE_ID=optional_member_role
VERIFY_ALLOWED_ROLE_ID=optional_verifier_role
VERIFIED_ROLE_ID=only_needed_when_htb_enrollment_is_re-enabled
GITHUB_TOKEN=only_needed_when_github_invites_are_re-enabled
GH_INVITE_REPO_OWNER=only_needed_when_github_invites_are_re-enabled
GH_INVITE_REPO_NAME=only_needed_when_github_invites_are_re-enabled
```

## Run the bot

```bash
bun install
bun run build
bun start
```

Development mode:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Useful scripts:

```bash
bun run check       # formatting, lint, build, and deterministic tests
bun run audit       # scan direct and transitive dependencies
bun run test        # deterministic local tests (no network)
bun run test:smoke  # optional live CTFtime API smoke test
bun run lint        # lint src/ with zero warnings allowed
bun run format      # format TypeScript and root JSON files
```

Maintenance scripts operate on `DB_PATH` or `./ctf.db` when `DB_PATH` is unset:

```bash
bunx tsx scripts/fix-ctf-visibility.ts          # preview lifecycle permission fixes
bunx tsx scripts/fix-ctf-visibility.ts --apply  # apply lifecycle permission fixes
bunx tsx scripts/check-purged.ts                 # mark missing Discord categories as purged
bunx tsx scripts/purge-stale-roles.ts            # preview orphaned per-CTF role deletion
bunx tsx scripts/purge-stale-roles.ts --apply    # delete eligible orphaned roles
```

Stop the bot before running a script that changes the database. Always run the dry-run form first where one is available.

## Main flow

1. `src/index.ts` loads config, creates the Discord client, imports all commands, and registers slash commands for `SERVER_ID`.
2. A slash command interaction is routed to the matching command object from the command collection.
3. CTFtime commands use `ctftime.service.ts` to fetch and format CTFtime event data.
4. Registration commands use `discord.service.ts` to create roles, categories, channels, and scheduled events.
5. Registration state is saved through `database.service.ts` into `ctf.db`.
6. Button interactions are handled by `components/buttons.ts` for pagination and delete confirmations.
7. Logs are written through `utils/logger.ts`.

## Database model

The SQLite database stores CTFs, challenge state, dashboards, reminders, solved records, and the currently-disabled club-task workflow.

- `metadata`: stores small bot metadata, currently including the CTF counter.
- `ctfs`: stores registered CTFs and separate competition/archive times.
- `ctf_challenges`, `solved_challenges`: challenge ownership and solve state.
- `ctf_dashboards`, `ctf_reminders`: persistent dashboard and scheduler state.

Each CTF row stores:

- CTFtime ID
- Discord role ID
- Discord category ID
- CTF display name
- info message ID
- main/info channel ID
- archive timestamp
- archive state
- created/updated timestamps

## Notes for code readers

- Commands follow the shared `Command` interface in `src/types/index.ts`: each command exports `data` and `execute`.
- `src/index.ts` is the command registry. If a command is not imported and added there, Discord will not receive it.
- `ctftime.service.ts` is responsible for remote CTFtime data and embed content.
- `discord.service.ts` is responsible for Discord side effects.
- `database.service.ts` is responsible for persistent local state.
- `components/buttons.ts` must understand any custom button IDs created by commands or embed builders.
- Generated JavaScript and declaration files are written to `dist/` by `bun run build`.
